Installer for Ubuntu on Chromebooks
===============================================

This script will install everything necessary to transform an Acer C720 into a
laptop. Primarily this involves partitioning the built-in SSD and
installing Ubuntu along with various patches and customizations.

Upon completion, you will be able to boot into both ChromeOS (CTRL-D) or Ubuntu
(CTRL-L) from the developer mode boot screen.

Supported device(s)

**ATTENTION: This will wipe everything on your device**

1. Enable [developer mode](http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/developer-information-for-chrome-os-devices/acer-c720-chromebook).
